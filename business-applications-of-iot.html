                    <p>More and more devices are becoming "smart" and connected to the network. And by "network" I don't mean the electric grid, but the global information network. For example - who had heard about
        a "smart" watch a couple of years ago? Even they are no longer seen as something new. It is now up to other devices to get "smarter" and form the so-called Internet of Things.</p>

    <p>The Internet of Things is the network of interconnected devices (things) that can exchange data with each other, are connected to the internet and in short - they can be managed even from your
        phone. At first it sounds superfluous for the stove to have access to the web, but it's pretty cool to get home from work and be greeted by the aroma of a freshly baked roastbeef.</p>

    <p>Of course, culinary is not the only application of these evolved devices - every small and medium business can benefit from them and here I am going to list some interesting applications.</p>

    <h2>Smart bulbs</h2>

    <p>Yes, those bulbs. And yes, with the Internet, why not? At present, many companies are producing the so-called smart bulbs. LED technology is used, which is nice because it reduces the
        electricity bill. So, what is the real benefit of a smart bulb?</p>

    <h3>Remote control</h3>

    <p>These bulbs can be controlled by a very large set of devices including phone, computer, a special remote and more. A lot of useful functionality especially for people who forget to turn off
        the lights when leaving a certain subject. There are patterns that allow automatic switching even when you are only a certain distance from them. You can also set a timer to determine when
        to turn it on and off.</p>

    <h3>Wide range of colors.</h3>

    <p>Most bulbs allow you to choose the color of your lighting.</p>

    <p>Business Application: I've already mentioned the option to turn them off remotely if you have forgotten them, but that's not the only plus. Shop owners would benefit from being able to quickly
        and easily adjust the lights. Also the wide range of colors gives you an easy way to create an atmosphere. If you have a large room, you can set them to automatically turn on only in the area
        you are currently in.</p>

    <h2>Smart alarms</h2>

    <p>Alarm systems are not new. Also, they are usually connected in some way with some communication system to tell the guards about a potential problems. The bad thing is that they are amazingly
        stiff. Anyone, who has used such system, has activated it by mistake at least once, has wondered how to turn it on or off, has entered the wrong code until the guards show up, etc. Smart
        alarm systems solve these problems. Different systems are equipped with various sensors - vibration, infrared, temperature, motion, proximity, and more. After configuring the alarm, you start
        to receive notifications every time one of the sensors detects something you have defined as "not normal". There are systems equipped with camera and/or speakers, that can help you see what's
        happening in real time, and startle the offender (or colleague :) ). Other systems offer small components
        (<a href="http://www.allbe1.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">for example</a>), again fitted with a large array of sensors, that you can use to track what you want
        (e.g. bicycle, laptop, dog, etc.) or let you know if the UV levels are too high.</p>

    <p>Business Application: Generally, these alarms can be used for a lot of things - first of all their traditional function, but done in a much more convenient and elegant way, but also - to keep
        and track your personal belongings, to check who accesses your personal space such as rooms, drawers, etc., and even find your car in an underground parking.</p>

    <h3>Smart Button</h3>

    <p>This is no longer a new thing, and yet it's pretty cool. It is a programmable button that connects to another smart device and sends commands when being pressed. There is an option to change
        the commands according to the type of press.</p>

    <p>Business application: This thing should be present in every restaurant - short press calls the waiter, long press asks for the bill. The possibilities, of course, are not limited to
        this - with this button you can allow someone to have partial access to other clever things without being fully connected.</p>

    <h2>Complete solutions</h2>

    <p>As a kind of a conclusion I want to mention probably the coolest aspect of the IoT devices - interconnection. What this means is you can connect everything with everything, creating pretty
        complicated systems, that can do a lot with the right software.
    If you really want to (or need to) you can make whole "smart homes", "smart offices", "smart conference rooms" or even hotels, buildings, etc. Only thing you need in addition to well designed
        IoT hardware is the software to monitor and manage it.
