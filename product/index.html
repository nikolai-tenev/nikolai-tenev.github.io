                        <h3>Real time maps</h3>
                        <p>This is a very business specific module, it can differ vastly from one company to the other
                            or it can be omitted altogether.</p>
                        <p>At its core this is a map showing data in real time. You can also interact with it and
                            control the objects shown.</p>
                        <p>There are no limits as to what objects the map can display.</p>
                        <p>Just a few examples are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vehicles - cars, bikes, drones, choppers, planes, etc.</li>
                            <li>Cameras</li>
                            <li>Buildings</li>
                            <li>Trackers - fitness, animal, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Aside from objects the map can display layers of information. Layers are mostly used for
                            visualization purposes.</p>

                            You can also add new objects and modify or delete existing ones.</p>
                        <p>When browsing the list, you can do a regular search or use a filter.</p>

                        <p>The timeline shows a set of events in chronological order.</p>
                        <p>Different controls can be integrated allowing you to accomplish tasks related to the

                        <h3>Real time alerts, statuses and messaging</h3>
                        <p>This module is very useful when acting fast is required. Every alert, status and message is
                            processed in a near real time fashion.</p>
                        <p>Alerts can be defined based on different criteria like time, object location, data access,
                            etc.
                            After the defined event happens an alert will be displayed in the platform. Additionally,
                            alerts can be configured
                            to send emails.</p>
                        <p>Statuses are similar to alerts but they are shown in a different manner. Usually they are
                            embedded in
                            a status dashboard and serve as a gauge.</p>
                        <p>With messaging you can send simple text messages to other users of the platform. Email
                            notifications can be
