<p>This is a web application that is a customized ERP and CRM system. It's used to manage and analyze company resources, generate reports, set reminders, track progress for certain specific
    processes, etc. It was designed to fully meet the needs of the company, it was built for, by tailoring every "screen" of the app to the individual needs of the people working with it.</p>

<p>Some of the more interesting features include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Entering information in a convenient and quick way
        <ul>
            <li>Intuitive CRUD screens</li>
            <li>CRUD screens for multiple related entities, when needed</li>
            <li>Easy to use custom made controls like drag and drop, comboboxes and others</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Generating customized reports</li>
    <li>Sending messages</li>
    <li>Alarms, that remind you to do something within a given deadline</li>
    <li>Some real-time status updates</li>
</ul>

<p>We used our favourite Spring Framework and React.js combo as we've found out it works out pretty well. We used a traditional SQL database, because the project didn't require the usage of a
    NoSQL option.</p>
