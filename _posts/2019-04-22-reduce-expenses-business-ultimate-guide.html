<p>This is my advanced guide to reduce your business costs without sacrificing quality.</p>
<p>Prior to writing this I've done quite a lot of research and I've also included some real-life examples from my
    experience.</p>
<p>I've intentionally avoided some cost reduction techniques, because in the end they'll bring more harm than good. I'll
    add them to the <a href="#bad-cost-cutting">Bad cost cutting</a> section.</p>

<p>Before we begin I have to make 1 thing clear:</p>
<p><strong>It will be best to implement these strategies before you actually need to.</strong> You should look at this article more as a
    business optimisation guide, that focuses on reducing unnecessary costs, rather
    than a salvage my company kind of guide.</p>
<p>The main idea is to achieve effective, sustainable, long-term cost reduction for your company, without sacrificing
    any of the quality or value you provide.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say is:</p>
<p><em>If your revenue is low and your reserves are non-existent, then it's probably a bit late.</em></p>
<p>The reasons for this are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>It's better to never reach a moment when your business actually needs to reduce expenditure in order to stay
        afloat. This makes you vulnerable to making bad decisions.
    </li>
    <li>The best ways to reduce costs usually require an upfront investment. Which is hard to do, when you don't have
        enough money.
    </li>
    <li>It takes time to see the positive effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the best part about this approach:</p>
<p><strong>If you do this right, you're probably going to increase the overall effectiveness of your business, which should be
        one of the main goals for every businessman.</strong></p>

<p>Now that we are past the disclaimer let's dive right in!</p>
<p>Following are some ideas and examples on how to cut costs efficiently.</p>
<h3 id="general-tips">General tips for sustainable business cost reduction</h3>
<p>Or put another way:</p>
<p>These are my universal tips that can be applied in most situations. They are not specific to manufacturing, operations,
    marketing, finance, etc.</p>
<h4 id="monitor-analyze-optimize">Monitor, analyze, optimize.</h4>
<img class="img-fluid" data-src="/assets/img/posts/images/reduce-expenses-business-ultimate-guide/monitor-analyze-optimize.jpg"
     alt="Always monitor, analyze and optimize your business"
     title="Always monitor, analyze and optimize your business">
<p>I know it sounds a little bit generic, but this is probably <em>the most important and effective thing anybody can do in
    their efforts to reduce expenditure, increase revenue and get the maximum <a
        href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp">return
            for your investments</a></em>.</p>
<p>This is the reason why different business intelligence and management systems are so wide spread.</p>
<p>They can give you invaluable insights about where you can easily make changes, that will be very profitable, or help
    you identify hidden blockages and "leaks".
</p>
<p>There are quite a few steps you must take before successfully creating or integrating such system.</p>

<p>2 of them are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>You have to know the specifics of your business and know what to track.</strong></p>
        <p>You can always go all in, but sometimes that's a bit of an overkill. It's better to start with essential
            stuff and then add more as your preferences change or grow.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>You have to be able to "evolve and adapt".</strong></p>
        <p>What this means is:</p>

        <p>Your system has to be able to change and grow with you. Your business is not static, so the tools you use
            shouldn't be as well.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>My clients have shared all kinds of different findings with me, gathered with the help of their
    <a href="https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/ERP.html" title="What is an ERP system">ERPs</a> and
    <a href="https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/definition/business-intelligence-BI"
       title="What is business intelligence">business intelligence</a> systems.
</p>
<p>From small things like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>One department using a few times more office supplies than the others, because employees use them for personal
        stuff
    </li>
    <li>Workers coming systematically too late to work</li>
</ul>
<p>To bigger things like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Some drivers driving way more carelessly than others and thus causing cars to break down faster</li>
    <li>Drivers taking running personal errands and thus increasing fuel expenditure significantly.</li>
</ul>
<p>To some, who did major shifts in their companies.</p>
<h4 id="planning">Planning and budgeting.</h4>
<img class="img-fluid" data-src="/assets/img/posts/images/reduce-expenses-business-ultimate-guide/planning-budgeting.jpg"
     alt="Planning and budgeting are important for your business"
     title="Planning and budgeting are important for your business">
<p>Remember how in the beginning I talked about not waiting for the last moment to implement cost reduction strategies?
    Well, it's kind of connected to this.
</p>
<p>This might sound a bit complicated but if done right it'll give you a lot of insights about the way your company is
    going and whether or not a certain task is feasible or not.
</p>
<p><strong>The main idea is to plan ahead.</strong> Basically you need to:</p>

<ol start="1">
    <li>Set a goal you want your business to achieve.</li>
    <li>Determine the steps that you need to take to reach that goal.</li>
    <li>Allocate the needed resources for each step.</li>
    <li>Start executing the steps.</li>
    <li>Analyze the results and eventually adjust course if they are not the expected ones.</li>
</ol>
<p>There's also a little trick that I use:</p>
<p>If for some reason I can't figure out a certain step - I don't know how to do it or how much to budget for it or
    something else, I break it down into smaller steps that I can accomplish easily.
<em>If you accomplish the smaller steps, you have accomplished the big one as well.</em>
</p>
<p>A good business planning or management application can help a lot with that. The detailed statistics provided by
    such tools are great for planning. You'll be able to examine closely how your business functioned in
    previous periods, keeping everything on track.
</p>
<h4 id="automation">Automate as much as possible.</h4>
<img class="img-fluid" data-src="/assets/img/posts/images/reduce-expenses-business-ultimate-guide/automate.jpg"
     alt="Automate to reduce expenses"
     title="Automate to reduce expenses">
<p>This is kind of obvious, right?</p>

<p>After all:</p>
<p><strong>Reduction in the tasks you have to do manually means reducing time wasted.</strong></p>
<p>Still a lot of businesses struggle with that part. Either because they don't want to invest in it, thinking it won't
    benefit them, or because they are afraid something will go wrong and believe
    they are perfectly fine the way they are.
</p>
<p><em>Even if you are OK at the moment it doesn't mean you shouldn't try to improve.</em></p>

<p>Some of the biggest companies in the world are successfully cutting costs with automation. <a
        href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/30/alibaba-cainiao-chinas-biggest-robot-warehouse-for-singles-day.html">At
        "Alibaba" they use robots in their warehouses</a>, <a
        href="https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2015/08/21/fully-automated-lettuce-factory-to-open-in-japan/">"Spread"
        uses robotics to farm lettuce</a> and <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/article/adidas-manufacturing-idUSL8N13X3CQ20151209">"Adidas"
        uses robots to make running shoes</a>.
</p>
<p>There are many more examples, just check out what the guys at
    <a href="https://www.bostondynamics.com/" title="Boston Dynamics">Boston Dynamics</a> are doing:</p>

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 my-4">
    <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5iV_hB08Uns"
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>This shows us that saving with automation works and it works really well. Otherwise
    nobody would have put the time and effort to research and create fully automated
    manufacturing facilities.
</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you can do it on this scale or not. You can always use the help of computers to automate some
    of the smaller things in your business and reduce your expenses this way.
</p>

<p>Some examples, just to get you started:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You can automate communication to get custom alerts, whenever something you care about happens. E.g.
    when a server is down, when you receive comment on your blogs, whenever somebody tries to access resources without
    proper authorization, etc.</li>
    <li>You can automate sending different "Thank you" messages or even client onboarding. More advanced features are
        made available from the different customer support tools out there.</li>
    <li>You can automate price estimates, orders, invoices, billing, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>With recent advances a lot of stuff that was pretty hard to do in the past is easily achievable today.</p>

<h4 id="outsourcing">Outsource everything you can.</h4>
<img class="img-fluid" data-src="/assets/img/posts/images/reduce-expenses-business-ultimate-guide/outsource.jpg"
     alt="Outsourcing can save a lot of money and hassle"
     title="Outsourcing can save a lot of money and hassle">
<p>Nowadays there's a company for everything.</p>

<p><em>You don't want to deal with HR?</em></p>
<p>There's a company that does this.</p>

<p><em>You don't want to deal with sales?</em></p>
<p>No problem!</p>

<p><em>Marketing? Advertising? Accounting?</em></p>
<p>You're covered.</p>
<p><strong>In general outsourcing everything that is not your forte is the way to go.</strong></p>
<p>Hiring personnel is expensive and it's not worth it outside your core activity.</p>

<p>You'll waste a lot of time finding the right candidate. The lack of experience can lead to serious problems and
    expenses and since you aren't a pro yourself you can't really train somebody. You can
    just hope for the best, which isn't the best strategy for anything.
</p>
<p>There is the option to hire a trainer to train your staff.</p>
<p><strong>I think that's even worse.</strong> Here's why:</p>
<p>Instead of paying somebody to do the task at hand, you'll be paying somebody to teach you how to do it. And you'll be
    paying premium, because trainers usually aren't cheap.
</p>
<p>Besides I'm far from convinced that when the training is done the trainees will be as good at the task at hand as the
    trainer is.
</p>
<p>Hiring a highly specialized company will give you all the benefits and none of the problems. You get a lot of
    experience, skills, contacts, tools, knowledge, know-how, etc. that you would otherwise
    have to spend a fortune on.
</p>
<p><em>More importantly you get a partner, that is highly motivated to help you, because that's their business.</em></p>

<p>Your only concern is probably going to be management. But provided you have the right management software you should
    be fine.</p>
<h3 id="operational-costs">Cut operational costs.</h3>
<h4 id="erp-business-management-software">Use ERP or other business management software.</h4>

<p>There's a reason why these tools are so widely adopted in businesses over the globe:</p>

<p><strong>They work!</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to cost reduction seeing data organised in charts and tables is invaluable. It makes identifying
    problems a breeze.
</p>
<p>Now all that's left to do is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Check cash flows.</li>
    <li>Check resource expenditure.</li>
    <li>Optimize!</li>
</ul>
<p>Feeling confused? Let me clarify:</p>
<p>You need to analyze where cash and company resources are going, how are they being spent and if that level of
    spending is expected and normal.
</p>
<p>Afterwards if you find something unusual you need to investigate and optimize the process or if you deem it
    unnecessary - remove it completely.
</p>
<p><em>After integrating an ERP and doing some A/B testing one of my clients reported, that buying a different brand of
        screwdriver bits resulted in spending 20% less for bits and using them 15% longer on average.</em>
</p>
<p>See how you can save easily on smaller things?</p>
<p>OK, next one:</p>
<h4 id="fixed-assets">Use your fixed assets as efficiently as you can.</h4>
<img class="img-fluid" data-src="/assets/img/posts/images/reduce-expenses-business-ultimate-guide/efficient-assets.jpg"
     alt="Using fixed assets efficiently can save money"
     title="Using fixed assets efficiently can save money">
<p>It could be office space, production real estate, big machinery, etc. but it should be used to its fullest potential.
</p>

<p>I don't mean using your meeting rooms once in a week or your multi spindle drilling machine once in a month. You have
    to be putting your assets to work as close to 100% of the time as you can get.
</p>
<p>Here are a couple of ways to do it:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Some of your office spaces can have two functions. Your meeting room can be your break room or you can combine
        storage and printing.
    </li>
    <li>You can rent out spaces you're currently not using.</li>
    <li>You can offer usage of your assets as a service. Smaller companies, DIYers, handymen, etc. that don't have access to
        such big machines will gladly use that.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's of course one problem that can quickly arise:</p>
<p><strong>Bad scheduling.</strong></p>
<p>It can be easily remedied with a good management or scheduling application. This way you'll always be in control of
    your schedules and there won't be any mixups.
</p>
<p>If you own a sports facility, then good scheduling is crucial for you. You need it in order to optimize your usage of
    the playgrounds and maximize the time in which you're making money out of them, thus reducing loses.
</p>
<p>If you are a bit more enthusiastic about automation in a lot of cases you can integrate a great deal of
    interconnected devices and an admin dashboard for them. This way you will be able to control your schedules and the
    devices from the same application. <em>This is a real time and money saver</em> - if we go back to the sports facility
    example turning the lights and music off and locking a room could be happening with a mouse click.
</p>
<p>My next tip is better suited for smaller businesses (of course it'll work well for medium sized companies as well):
</p>
<h4 id="coworking">Use coworking office spaces or even work fully remotely.</h4>
<p>Now this can save a substantial amount of cash. <a
        href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryalton/2017/05/09/why-more-millennials-are-flocking-to-shared-office-spaces/">Shared
        offices are cheaper</a> in comparison to renting or buying a traditional office.</p>
<p>Also you get the added benefit of somebody taking care of utilities, maintenance, etc.</p>
<p>If you want to expand this further and if your business allows it - you can offer telecommuting or even go the fully
    remote (or office-free) way. A lot of companies are doing this and
    <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/01/31/work-from-home-in-2017-the-top-100-companies-offering-remote-jobs/">the
        trend is going up</a>.
</p>
<p>It's good for office morale and for your wallet. Working remotely usually means happier employees, which is always a
    good thing. But it'll also potentially save you from utility costs (like
    electricity, water, internet, etc.) and office space.
</p>
<p>Besides reducing costs, this way of working has other benefits. The <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/">University of
        Ohio</a> created a
    <a href="https://onlinemasters.ohio.edu/blog/how-telecommuting-can-save-businesses-money/">very
        nice article and infographic on the topic</a>, which you can check out here:
</p>
<p><strong>(After that I'm talking about a potential issue with remote work and how to solve it)</strong>
</p>
<p style="clear:both;margin-bottom:20px;">
    <a href="https://onlinemasters.ohio.edu/blog/how-telecommuting-can-save-businesses-money/">
        <img data-src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/utep-uploads/wp-content/uploads/sparkle-box/2018/03/22163308/telecommuting-can-save-businesses-money-image.jpg"
             alt="Telecommuting Can Save Businesses Money infographic" style="max-width:100%;"/>
    </a>
</p>
<p>The potential issue I mentioned is this:</p>
<p><strong>Management.</strong></p>
<p>Managing a team remotely can be a challenge. You have to figure out ways of communication (don't forget
    that you might have personnel in different time zones), task assignments, file sharing, etc.
</p>
<p>My experience shows that technology can help a lot for this. You have different issue tracking systems like: <a
        href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a>,
    <a
        href="https://asana.com/">Asana</a>, <a
        href="https://trello.com">Trello</a>. Everybody is using
    messaging apps nowadays, so I'm only going to mention Skype, Slack and <a
        href="https://hangouts.google.com/">Google Hangouts</a>
    as the most popular ones. File sharing is also pretty easy: <a
        href="https://www.dropbox.com/">DropBox</a>, <a
        href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Google Drive</a> are
    just 2 of the many alternatives you can use.

    In the end it all comes down to preference, but the more things you can do with one app and the more it's suited for
    your specific needs - the better. You will easily save time and headaches if you
    can consolidate your management efforts in as little applications as possible or in a single customized one.
</p>
<h4 id="meetings">Meetings are time wasters.</h4>
<img class="img-fluid" data-src="/assets/img/posts/images/reduce-expenses-business-ultimate-guide/meetings-waste-time.jpg"
     alt="Most meetings waste valuable time"
     title="Most meetings waste valuable time">
<p>Yes, that's right, unless you're actually making key decisions or making money <a
        href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/why-99-percent-of-all-meetings-are-a-complete-wast.html">you're
        wasting time</a>.
</p>
<p>Often people tend to steer off of the agenda, talk about unrelated stuff and also forget about things they talked
    about later.
</p>
<p>You can easily drop most of the meetings if you use some kind of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_project_management_software">team
        tracking, organization and management app</a>.
</p>
<p>This way you will gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You will have history of everything that has been "said" on the given issue/task/theme/etc.</li>
    <li>It'll be a lot easier to assign tasks and have people do them.</li>
    <li>You can benefit from the so called "agile" methodologies for team management.</li>
    <li>If somebody starts working on a given issue later they'll be able to easily follow everything that was
        discussed prior to them joining.
    </li>
    <li>You don't have to do recaps and waste more time.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you have remote workforce you'll save even more from travel expenses.</em></p>
<h4 id="equipment">Be smart about equipment.</h4>
<img class="img-fluid" data-src="/assets/img/posts/images/reduce-expenses-business-ultimate-guide/smart-equipment.jpg"
     alt="Don't always buy new and expensive stuff"
     title="Don't always buy new and expensive stuff">
<p>You can always buy the newest and best of everything, but you also might not need it.</p>

<p>When you can buy second hand or refurbished stuff - do it, it's cheaper and you often get some remaining
    warranty.</p>

<p>If you want to buy a crane a used one is usually a much better choice. It'll cost a lot less (depending on the type
    of crane), but more importantly - <em>it should have a service history, with all the maintenance and repairs</em>. This
    way you can easily determine the condition of the machine and make educated decision on whether or not it's a good
    purchase.
</p>

<p>You can also rent equipment if you only use it once in a while.</p>
<p><em>You can rent out your own stuff when you don't need it.</em></p>
<p>An advice from me:</p>
<p><strong>Don't waste money on stuff you don't really need.</strong></p>
<p>I'll talk more about this later in this post.</p>
<h4 id="oss">Use free or open source software.</h4>
<p>There's a free alternative to pretty much any computer program you might be using. You can save a lot of money if you
    start using these.
</p>

<p>There's another added benefit:</p>
<p>You can make donations to the products you like the most whenever the right moment comes. This way you'll be making
    the world a better place and you also might get a mention on the product's
    sponsors page.
</p>
<p>Open source and free software has changed a lot since the days it was almost unusable (or non existent).</p>

<p>You have free operating systems (Linux), that work quite well and are becoming more and more user-friendly. There are
    free office suites, creativity apps, management apps, accounting software, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>It's a good practice to check for a free alternative whenever you consider buying a license, it might save
        you a lot!</strong> In some cases it might be even better than the paid alternative.
</p>
<p>I can give an example with myself:</p>
<p>This website is hosted for free on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages"
                                         target="_blank">github</a>, using free caching from
    <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" title="Cloudflare" target="_blank">cloudflare</a>. I'm using the
    <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll - Free static blog system" target="_blank">free blogging platform jekyll</a>
    to generate it and I'm writing this post for free in my google docs, running on my
    <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/" title="Arch Linux" target="_blank">free Arch Linux operating system</a>. I'm

    or <a href="https://inkscape.org/" title="Professional vector graphics editor " target="_blank">Inkscape</a>
    which are all free.
</p>
<p>Alright, next one is connected to this:</p>
<h4 id="website">Website.</h4>
<p>Before I give you the tips I must say this:</p>
<p><strong>Nowadays it's important for <em>every</em> business to have a website.</strong> Don't skimp on the cost
of a good website. It doesn't matter if you'll be investing in digital marketing or not. If somebody tries to look you
up you must show up in the results, otherwise you risk losing a client.</p>
<p>As for how to save from a business website, here are a few pointers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        In most of the cases you don't really need a custom made
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" title="What's a CMS" target="_blank">CMS</a>.
        You can use wordpress, joomla, drupal or even jekyll if you're OK with a more technical solution (as I
        mentioned in the previous section - that's the one I'm using).
    </li>
    <li>
        Be very careful where you get your domain name from. There are some domain registrars, who have hidden fees,
        really bad terms and conditions, bad support, etc. <strong>Do your research before buying, to save some money.
        </strong>
        In my research on the topic done in 2019 I gathered positive and negative feedback of people from different
        forums and I came to the conclusion that Google, CloudFlare, NameSilo and PorkBun are OK. Currently I'm using
        CloudFlare.
    </li>
    <li>
        Be really careful about hosting too. Again you should check different reviews (avoid the paid PR reviews,
        check reddit, forums, etc.). Price is important but also is performance and extras.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you want to save some cash from the design of your website you can always buy one from the different website
        template marketplaces like TemplateMonster. It's much cheaper this way, but you might end up with pretty much
        the same website as somebody else.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>OK, time to move to the next one and this is:</p>
<h4 id="recurring-payments">Try to avoid recurring payments. </h4>
<img class="img-fluid" data-src="/assets/img/posts/images/reduce-expenses-business-ultimate-guide/recurring-payments.jpg"
     alt="Avoiding recurring payments can save a lot"
     title="Avoiding recurring payments can save a lot">
<p>Renting has one big benefit:</p>
<p><em>It's easy and convenient.</em></p>

<p>Once or twice a month you need a bus to drive your workers somewhere or maybe a super powerful computer to render the
    video clip you made. It could also be power tools if you use wider range of
    them and you don't want to invest.
</p>
<p>Renting is viable solution to such problems. But these costs quickly add up and sometimes it makes more sense to just
    buy the thing you need.
</p>
<p>Just do a quick calculation of your renting costs for let's say 2 years versus the cost of just buying the thing. If
    renting is equal or higher - you know what to do.
</p>
<p>Even if it's not - the margin should be quite big for buying not to be the better option.</p>

<p>I'll give you another interesting example:</p>
<p><strong>Software licenses.</strong></p>
<p>More and more companies are providing their software as a service, not as a product. It's quite popular.</p>
<p>What this actually means is:</p>
<p>You have to make recurring payments monthly or yearly in order to have the most recent version.</p>
<p>There's also this new trend emerging in which you have to pay also per user.</p>

<p>The reasoning behind this payment model is that you are always getting the latest and greatest version of the
    software and that each user needs more resources provisioned on the provider's servers.
</p>
<p>The only problem is:</p>
<p><em>The benefits of always being on the bleeding edge of technology are at best debatable for most.</em></p>
<p>As for the per user cost - it's often caused by the fact that the provider is trying to serve <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem">a lot of clients at the same time</a>.
</p>
<p>Now a quick calculation:</p>
<p>Let's say you're paying for a small app (Slack is about $7 per month, per user). If you have 100 employees, that's
    $700 per month, for a single app. That is $8400 on the first year. $16 800 for two years. <strong>That can cover the
        costs for developing an enterprise chat application.</strong>
</p>
<p>You see how this can easily amount to piles of money going out of your company.</p>

<p>There are other problems as well:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You get functionality you don't need, but you're paying for it</li>
    <li>You don't get the functionality you actually need, although you're paying for it</li>
    <li>Support usually isn't that great, performance may be pretty bad, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>What you can do about it?</p>

<p><em>Talk to a development agency and ask them to create something that will suit your needs.</em>
    The initial costs will be higher, but having no recurring licence payments will
    quickly catch up. Afterwards you only pay when you need additional stuff developed.
</p>
<h4 id="upgrade">Upgrade.</h4>
<p>Your software, your hardware, your tools, your appliances, your offices, everything.</p>
<p>Here's why:</p>
<p><strong>By upgrading old equipment you're gaining better performance.</strong></p>
<p>More often than not a performance boost results in time and money savings.</p>
<p>Of course this should be taken with a grain of salt, because not every upgrade is worth it.</p>
<p>We are a software company, so as expected we work on computers to create, well... software.</p>
<p>Probably most people think that because computers are our main tool, we are always working on cutting edge tech.
    <strong>And they are wrong.</strong>
</p>
<p>We haven't upgraded our CPUs for the last 4 years, because the performance gain for the things we do would be less
    than 5%. But we do use high-end SSDs <strong>despite their high cost, because the gain is
        significant.</strong>
</p>
<p>We do use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release">rolling-release</a> linux operating system (<a
        href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>) in order to always have up-to-date software, again because we
    need this and it's very beneficial to us.
</p>
<p>Even if you own a restaurant - a new high-end coffee maker will be better than an old one - it'll work faster, it'll
    make better coffee and it'll break down less often.
</p>
<p>If you're into car repairs better tools means better and faster repairs.</p>

<p>If you're a carpenter having new and powerful drill and table saw is going to make things easier for you, which again
    means reducing overall costs.
</p>
<p>Same applies for pretty much every business, so don't be afraid to invest.</p>

<p>Just be smart about it:</p>
<p><em>Don't hesitate to buy the things that will make you money, but avoid unnecessary purchases.</em></p>
<h4 id="employee-monitoring">Employee monitoring.</h4>
<img class="img-fluid" data-src="/assets/img/posts/images/reduce-expenses-business-ultimate-guide/employee-monitoring.jpg"
     alt="It's important to know the strengths and weaknesses of your employees"
     title="It's important to know the strengths and weaknesses of your employees">
<p>Let me make one thing clear:</p>

<p>Nobody likes to be watched over like it's 1984.</p>
<p>But unobtrusive monitoring of your employees' activity has its benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit #1:</strong> You will find the slackers. People that come way too late to work or that take way too long lunch breaks
    regularly. What you do with them depends on a lot of things and is out of the
    scope of this post.
</p>
<p><strong>Benefit #2:</strong> You will understand what the strengths and the weaknesses of your employees are. You'll find who are the
    employees that give you the most value. More importantly - over time you'll be
    able to use your employees' skills more efficiently, because you'll know what they are good at.
</p>
<p>A management application can help a lot with that. You can check when employees come to the office, when they go to
    and return from breaks and when they leave the office. You can also check the
    time it takes somebody to complete a task and privately rate if they did a good job or not.
</p>
<p>Managing and task distribution becomes way easier, when you have the right data. <strong>Effective management
        is one of the best ways to reduce costs in business.</strong></p>
<h4 id="reward-value">Reward value given to the company.</h4>
<p>Encourage your employees to give value to the company. <em>Rewarding for time spent in the workplace is kind of old
        school and it's not the most efficient tactic.</em>
</p>
<p>We've all seen (either on TV or in the real life) this one employee that constantly plays games while "working".
    Over time this can add up to a lot of money wasted.
</p>
<p>So it's a good idea to encourage employees to give value to the company. You can do that by organising trainings,
    giving a bonus for a job well done, have flexible working hours, etc.
</p>
<p>Of course you should always monitor and evaluate performance, so that you'll have statistics and history of what
    happened.
</p>
<p>All in all implementing this strategy should reduce operational costs, but more importantly - it should also
    increase employee output.</p>
<h4 id="working-hours">Reduce working hours.</h4>
<img class="img-fluid" data-src="/assets/img/posts/images/reduce-expenses-business-ultimate-guide/reduce-working-hours.jpg"
     alt="Reducing working hours has potential benefits"
     title="Reducing working hours has potential benefits">
<p>This one is a bit counter intuitive and controversial.</p>

<p>Just bare with me:</p>
<p>Recent studies report that <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-07-four-day-weeks-days.html">reduced working hours
        actually pay off</a> and that <a href="https://www.vouchercloud.com/resources/office-worker-productivity">the
        average worker is clocking in no more than 3-4 hours</a>. This applies especially to creative activities or
    ones that involve a lot of thinking. So if your type of business allows it, you could reduce working hours a bit.
</p>
<p>This way you will gain from the increased productivity and save from office costs. <strong>Also don't forget the happiness
        factor.</strong> Everybody at the office will love you for the improved work-life balance.
<em>Happy employees are much more likely to bring greater value to your company than unhappy ones.</em></p>
<h4 id="supplies">Reduce supply expenditure.</h4>
<p>This can save a lot of money for some businesses like food joints, carpenters, car repair shops, construction businesses, etc.
</p>
<p>You can monitor closely the usage of materials and try to optimize it.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying leaks is important</strong> - there
    could be somebody "borrowing" stuff from you, an employee working very inefficiently with some material or
    something else that's creating excess usage of supplies, that remains hidden.
</p>

<p>After finding these issues you should fix them and make sure they are less likely to happen again in the future.</p>

<p>What's more important:</p>
<p><strong>You should always check the most recent price lists of suppliers</strong>, because there could be significant differences with
    the price you're getting from your current supplier.
</p>
<p>If you find out that you're being charged more you can either switch or let your current supplier know about it and
    ask for a discount.
</p>
<p>Automating this process can make your life a lot easier, because receiving a notification whenever a lower price
    appears is much more efficient and time saving than having to go through a bunch of
    price lists every week.
</p>
<h4 id="digital">Go digital as much as you can.</h4>
<p>Printing is expensive, archiving stuff on paper even more so.</p>
<p>Since computers are a big part of our lives you can save a buck if you decide to <strong>drop printing and paper
        altogether.</strong>
</p>
<p>Another benefit of digitalisation is that it's much more convenient - sending an email is a lot faster than printing
    something and sending it over conventional mail.
</p>
<p>Also if you're going the digital route, archived documents can be indexed and then easily searched for the tiniest
    bit of information when you need it. <strong>This is way cheaper than paying for physical document storage
        and much more efficient if you're trying to find some offer from ten years ago.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If phone calls are a significant part of your business again you can benefit from digital services. Landlines
    usually cost more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP">VoIP</a> and have worse quality.
</p>

<p><strong>A lot of management can be digitalised as well</strong>. This does not lead directly to cost cutting, but it
    would improve efficiency a lot and will reduce wasted time, errors and other different misunderstandings.</p>

<p>For example integrating a good team management system can be incredibly beneficial. What you get is a central
    repository with all projects, all the tasks of all employees (and your own if you want to), etc.</p>
<p>Everybody sees only the things they need to.</p>
<p><em>This way you won't have employees forgetting what they had to do.</em></p>
<p>A good user interface helps a lot because it lets everybody use the application, but more importantly it provides
    ease of use:</p>

<ul>
    <li>searching and grouping of tasks</li>
    <li>color coding</li>
    <li>adding different types of media</li>
    <li>many more</li>
</ul>

<p>You also get automatic "deadlines", reminders and alerts for your tasks. Also task queuing can be automated. It's
    determined either by creation order or by task "weight".</p>
<p>Of course if you're building a custom team or a whole business management suite you can add whatever
    functionality you want.</p>
<p>In the long run this will substantially reduce wasted money and time <strong>(so it's a good cost cutter)</strong>.
</p>

<p>Of course you don't have to stop here, using technology can help in a lot of aspects of your business. <strong>You've
    probably noticed that most of the problems mentioned in this article have a working solution using computers and
    applications.</strong>
</p>
<h4 id="production-costs">Cut production costs.</h4>
<img class="img-fluid" data-src="/assets/img/posts/images/reduce-expenses-business-ultimate-guide/cut-production-costs.jpg"
     alt="How to reduce production costs"
     title="How to reduce production costs">
<p>In the process of creating a material product a lot of businesses have leftovers, cut-outs, scraps and any other kind
    of stuff that goes to waste in the end.
</p>
<p>There are a couple of cost saving measures you can take to reduce waste and losses:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Recycling is sometimes an option, although it's kind of a last resort one.</li>
    <li>You can use some simple design tool, CAD software or some custom application to optimize the way you use
        materials. Let's say you're in the carpentry business and you're using
        chipboard. An app can create optimized cutting diagram that will save you material and therefore money.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>You can sell leftovers. There are <a
            href="http://fortune.com/2015/04/16/could-these-apps-solve-americas-huge-food-waste-problem/">a
            ton of initiatives out there for restaurants, cafes and all other types of food joints trying to reduce
            food waste</a>. Some of them sell the food at lower prices at the end of the day, others just give it away.
    </li>
    <li>In some cases good inventory and production management can help. You can use an application that will help you
        determine the optimal quantities you should buy of each product and
        the optimal quantities you should produce. This way much less products will go bad, remain unsold, etc. reducing
        your overall expenditure significantly.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="vehicles">Lower vehicle expenses.</h4>
<img class="img-fluid" data-src="/assets/img/posts/images/reduce-expenses-business-ultimate-guide/vehicle-costs.jpg"
     alt="Vehicles cost a lot"
     title="Vehicles cost a lot">
<p>Vehicles are a rather big expense generator.</p>

<p>Fortunately there are ways to optimize depending on the situation.</p>
<p>You can buy older cars in order to cut on the initial price. Usually a car, that's just a few years old, can cost
    20-30% less.
</p>

<p>You can also buy vehicles which require much less operational costs in terms of fuel, maintenance and repairs.
    <strong>Diesel, hybrid and electrical vehicles can save a lot of money.</strong> It's advisable to
    check when they'll pay back the initial investment and whether or not that's in sync with your plans.
</p>
<p><em>When operating with a lot of cars proper vehicle management is crucial.</em></p>

<p>The reason for this is:</p>
<p>You have to maximize the utilisation of your vehicles, thus getting the most out of them. You don't want your cars
    sitting in a parking somewhere, that you pay for, if they can be making you money.
</p>
<p>A fleet management application can help a lot with this, alerting you whenever you need to change the oil or renew
    insurance, making proper usage schedules, etc.
</p>

    have already entered our lives.
</p>
<p>Interesting fact:</p>

<p>Leaving the lights on in the office overnight <a href="https://www.environment.admin.cam.ac.uk/facts-figures">wastes
        enough energy to make 1000 cups of tea</a>.
</p>
<p>Not to mention air conditioning, computers, etc. So integrating a smart system, that will turn off every device when
    it's not needed is a good way to save a lot of money.
</p>
<p>If you want to go one step further you can create more complex rules as to what is turned on or off and when.</p>

<p><strong>Some things you can do right away are:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use led lights, they save a lot</li>
    <li>Use laptops instead of desktops, unless you really need the extra horsepower.</li>
    <li>If you're shopping for machines try to buy the ones with the highest efficiency rating, especially when it comes
        to heating or cooling.
    </li>
    <li>Use high quality insulation for your office buildings</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="inventory">Don't keep excess inventory on hand.</h4>
<p>It might seem like a good idea to be "well stocked" but it actually leads to a lot of excess expenditure.</p>
<p>This is why:</p>
<ol start="1">
    <li><strong>You'll have to pay for storage.</strong> Depending on what you're storing and where you're storing it, this can be pretty
        expensive. Even if it's not, it's absolutely pointless to pay for
        something to just sit somewhere.
    </li>
    <li><strong>In some cases a new law or regulation might make a part of your stock unusable.</strong> If you're producing food, a new
        law might make all your food dyes or packaging unusable. If you're
        dealing with air conditioners you might be left with lots of unusable coolant, that you even have to pay to
        dispose of. Even if things like these are out of your scope you might decide you
        want to change the design of your labels. How is that going to happen if you're sitting on a few hundred
        thousand ready ones?
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Here's what you can do instead:</p>
<p>Invest in a good inventory management tool or module and do some inventory planning. You'll be able to create
    complicated schedules, to have statistics when you'll need more stock and when less and
    in general to predict what stock levels you'll need with great accuracy. It'll save you some cash and a lot of
    headaches.
</p>
<p>
    This rule applies only to inventory or stock, e.g. assets you put in your production. If you have an asset you keep
    in order to sell for a higher price (investment asset), that's OK. Just make sure that the sale margin is bigger
    than what you paid to keep the asset.

     title="How to save from finance services">
<p>If you own a company, chances are - you are using financial services. Be it a bank account, money transfers,
    insurances, etc. All these services add up when you grow and can become expensive.
</p>
<p><em>If your company is a big client of the finance sector you should always be trying to get a better deal.</em></p>

<p>Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Check the prices that other financial service providers are offering.</strong></p>
<p>Pay special attention to companies that would want and would try to win you over. Usually they'll give the best
    possible terms.
</p>
<p>If you are offered a better deal, contact your current provider and ask them to match those terms or even ask for
    better ones. If they don't do it, consider changing providers. This is a simple way to lower financial costs, that
    can be especially helpful for smaller businesses, where every dollar matters.
</p>
<h4 id="fintech">Use fintech services</h4>

</div>

<p>The finance sector is changing rapidly due to the mainstream adoption of technology.</p>
<p>There are a lot of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fintech.asp">new finance services</a>
    emerging that could give you a lot more bang for your buck.
</p>
<p>One good example are wire transfers, especially if currency conversion is involved.</p>
<p>Traditional banks usually give you absurd conversion rates and pretty bad transfer fees. Instead you can use one of
    the many money transfer services (like <a href="https://transferwise.com/">TransferWise</a>) with pretty much no
    fees and with reasonable conversion rates. <strong>I can tell you from personal experience, that this is actually
    saving me a lot of expenses.</strong> But more importantly it's a much more convenient and time-saving alternative.
</p>

<p>If you're using a business management application you can integrate payments in it. There are a lot of different
payment providers (like <a href="https://stripe.com/" title="Stripe" target="_blank">Stripe</a> or
    <a href="https://www.paypal.com" title="PayPal" target="_blank">PayPal</a>) making it possible to easily make
    payments from pretty much any application.
</p>

<h4 id="unneeded-services">Check if you really need all the services you are currently using.</h4>
<p>You might have a couple of overlapping insurances, a bank account you rarely use or something else. Whatever the case
    try and monitor for such things and remove them as soon as you can. Your business management tool should be able to
    help you with things like this.
</p>
<h4 id="late-payments">Avoid late payments.</h4>
<p>Not as easy as it sounds, right?</p>

<p>You could be waiting to be paid yourself or you could be receiving a ton of invoices on a monthly basis and you're
    simply forgetting about some of them.
</p>
<p>A little bit of management software can help a lot here. You can have alerts for invoices that are about to be due,
    you can also plan ahead to avoid not having enough cash on hand at the moment and
    having to pay more later.
</p>
<h3 id="marketing">Marketing</h3>

    <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LUbqRwp8NXI" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>Just like the finance sector, marketing is being revolutionized thanks to search engines, social networks, web forums
    and many other platforms that aggregate and show content in one way or another.
</p>
<p>If your business relies on advertisements to get new clients maybe you should shift your focus a bit to gain more for
    what you're paying. If done right digital marketing can have huge benefits, so
    maybe that TV or radio commercial that you're running and that's costing you an arm and a leg simply isn't worth it.
</p>
<p><strong>Digital marketing has the benefits of reaching very specifically targeted audiences</strong>, which are much more likely to
    buy. Also there's the benefit of being able to manage every aspect of your campaigns from your computer, which
    would save a lot of time.
</p>

<p><strong>Another important part of marketing is giving your company's name the brand status.</strong> This isn't easy to achieve, but
    digital marketing can help a lot. If you manage to do it, you'll gain big cuts in
    your advertisement expenses.
</p>
<p>Some of the easier steps to start walking towards the brand status are to post on specialized forums in order to show
    your expertise, maybe run a blog or post regularly in a magazine to gain more
    popularity, answer on platforms like <a href="https://www.quora.com/">quora</a>, etc.</p>
<p><em>In general digital marketing gives you much more bang for your buck.</em> Thus helping in the reduction of
the expenses for advertisements.

<h3 id="bad-cost-cutting">Bad cost cutting</h3>
<img class="img-fluid" data-src="/assets/img/posts/images/reduce-expenses-business-ultimate-guide/bad-cost-cutting.jpg"
     alt="There are also bad ways to cut costs"
     title="There are also bad ways to cut costs">
<p>Here it is, as promised in the beginning of this post - bad ways to reduce costs.</p>

<p>The number one rule of expenditure reduction is:</p>
<p><strong>You should never compromise the quality and value you provide to your customers and to your employees.
    </strong></p>
<p>Usually you can get away with a small drop in your services. Nobody is going to notice, right? Sadly in most cases
    that leads to more and more cuts being made and without even realising it you are
    on the track of rapidly losing your clients.
</p>
<p>The situation with your employees is similar.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well because of this simple equation:</p>
<p><strong>Unhappy employees = unhappy customers.</strong></p>
<p>Cutting salaries or benefits, providing cheap tools or worse - not providing them at all and in general - reducing
    the quality of the working environment in any way are all perfect examples of bad
    ways to cut costs. They lead to bad quality and low value of the services or products you provide. Ultimately
    they'll make your clients search for an alternative.
</p>
<p>As a main takeaway from this section I'll give you a list of measures, that I consider really bad and
    in some cases desperate cost cutting techniques, that I think, shouldn't be used:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lay offs, because employees are expensive. This was probably caused by hiring too much workforce in the first
        place or some other bad decision. Try not to do this, because it
        reduces morale, it damages your image and it's bad practice in general. However if you absolutely have to, then
        have meetings with the remaining employees and explain what is happening.
        Boosting morale in such situation is mandatory.
    </li>
    <li>Don't cut on employee perks. Especially if they are highly valued. You'll simply piss off your workers and
        sooner or later you'll suffer the consequences.</li>
    <li>Don't save from what you give to your clients. From smaller meals, through cheap knock-off parts, to bad
        untested software it's all going to make you lose clients.
    </li>
    <li>Don't start from Marketing. In a crysis one should try to get more business, which translates to more marketing
        effort, not to less.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there are more, but these aren't specific and apply to the majority of situations.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

    things you think are relevant. Of course I'll try to keep this guide updated with new and relevant information.
</p>

<p><em>Overall these are just some ideas on how to cut costs for your business.</em></p>

<p>Depending on your core activity there are probably much more things you could do.</p>
<p>The main takeaway is this:</p>
<p><strong>Don't sacrifice quality and value to reduce your expenses. These are desperate measures and they don't work long
    term. Try to act in advance, before things start to go bad.</strong>
