<p>Lately, in lots of online media outlets, we noticed an increasing interest in the topic of business plans.</p>
<p>One of the more important but often overlooked parts of a good business plan is the part dealing with financial projections.</p>
<p>Since calculating all the financial projections of a more detailed business plan can become cumbersome, we at DigidWorks decided to create a simple calculator to
    help aspiring and experienced entrepreneurs alike with all their business planning.</p>
<p><strong>This application is open sourced and completely free to use. It's licensed under the "Apache 2.0" license.</strong></p>

<p>Here we'll discuss how to make the most of the tool and quickly move forward with your road map.</p>
<h2>How to use the business budget calculator</h2>
<div class="blog-box p-4 mt-4 mb-5">
    <p><strong>The TLDR is:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>You add the income and costs that you forecasted for your business, and you get a 5-year financial projection.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Now, the full version.</p>
<p>The business budget calculator is a locally executed <a href="{%- post_url 2019-06-22-what-is-web-application-non-tech-explanation -%}" target="_blank"
                                                           title="Web applications - business definition">web application</a>
    without a web server processing the data. Every user is only able to see the data they enter.</p>
<p>There are three main parts in the application - the Dashboard, the Income, and the Costs.</p>
<p>The Dashboard gives you a 5-year financial projection based on the currently entered Income and Cost sources.</p>
<p>The Income part shows a list of all entered income sources. It gives you the option to enter new ones as well as edit and delete the ones you've already
    entered.</p>
<p>The Cost part is similar to the Income part. The only difference being it deals with the costs of your company.</p>
<p>When you fill out all your Income and Cost sources you can navigate to the Dashboard to see the results and use them in any way you want.</p>
<h3>Dashboard (Financial projections)</h3>
<p>The financial projections on the dashboard don't make any predictions, assumptions, or forecasts on your behalf.</p>
<p>This is a simple calculator that's to be used only to simplify date and period based calculations as these can get very cumbersome and are generally
    error-prone.</p>
<p><em>This is not an AI (artificial intelligence), ML (machine learning), or data-scraping tool that can give any additional insights as to what the actual financial
    results for your business will be.</em></p>
<h3>Types of cash flows (Income & Costs)</h3>
<p>There are several different time-bound types of Income & Cost sources. Their role is to make things easier when dealing with periodical cash flows.</p>
<p>You don't have to do any calculations yourself. You only mark the cash flow as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.</p>
<p>Of course, you can mark cash flows as one-time-only, too.</p>
<h4>Ongoing vs. periodical</h4>
<p>When you mark a cash flow as something other than one-time-only, you'll also be able to choose a period for it.</p>
<p>If this is a cash flow, that's not expected to end any time soon, you can mark it as ongoing. On the Dashboard, it'll be calculated for the whole 5-year
    period.</p>
<h3>More features</h3>
<p>Currently, this is a fairly simple application. If there's any feature you'd like to see implemented here, don't hesitate to
